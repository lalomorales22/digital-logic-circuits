## ‚ú® New Features

### 1. **Unique 3D Shapes for Each Gate Type** üé≠

Each logic gate now has its own distinctive 3D geometry:

| Gate | Shape | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **INPUT** | Hexagonal Cylinder | 6-sided cylinder for clear input identification |
| **OUTPUT** | Hexagonal Cone | Pyramid shape pointing upward |
| **AND** | Rectangular Box | Classic rectangular solid |
| **OR** | Ellipsoid Sphere | Stretched sphere for organic look |
| **NOT** | Diamond Pyramid | 4-sided pyramid rotated 45¬∞ |
| **NAND** | Octahedron | 8-sided diamond shape |
| **NOR** | Torus + Sphere | Donut ring with center sphere |
| **XOR** | Crossed Bars | Two angled bars with center sphere |
| **XNOR** | Tapered Cylinder | Cylinder that widens at base |

### 2. **Enhanced 3D Visual Effects** ‚ú®

- **Metallic Materials**: Gates now have metalness (0.6) and low roughness (0.3) for shiny appearance
- **Point Lights**: Active gates emit colored point lights that illuminate nearby objects
- **Glow Rings**: Active pins have animated glow rings
- **Pulsing Animation**: Gates pulse when carrying HIGH signals
- **Better Lighting**: 
  - Enhanced ambient light (0.7)
  - Stronger directional light (1.0)
  - Two colored point lights (purple and blue)

### 3. **Dot Grid System** üî≤

Replaced line grid with a modern dot grid system:
- **Small dots** every 0.5 units (spacing matches gate snapping)
- **Large dots** every 5 units for major grid lines
- **Subtle color** (#52525b) with transparency
- Professional appearance like high-end design tools

### 4. **Free Canvas Movement** üéØ

Enhanced OrbitControls for better navigation:
- **Zoom Range**: 5x to 100x (wider range)
- **Pan Speed**: Optimized for smooth movement
- **Mouse Controls**:
  - Left button: Pan
  - Middle button/scroll: Zoom
  - Right button: Pan (alternative)
- **Larger Ground Plane**: 200x200 units for unlimited placement

### 5. **Resizable Gates** üìè

Gates can now be scaled individually:
- **Scale Range**: 0.5x to 3x
- **Resize Method**: Hold `Shift` + scroll mouse wheel while gate is selected
- **Visual Feedback**: Scale indicator shows current size
- **Pin Adjustment**: Input/output pins automatically adjust position based on scale
- **Selection Rings**: Dynamically resize to match gate size

### 6. **Bright, Thick, Highlighted Wires** üí°

Major wire improvements for better visibility:
- **Thickness**: 
  - Active wires: 8 units (was 3)
  - Inactive wires: 4 units (was 2)
- **Glow Effect**: Active wires have triple-layer rendering:
  1. Main wire (green, thick)
  2. Glow layer (2.5x thicker, semi-transparent)
  3. Inner bright core (white, thin)
- **Pulsing Animation**: 
  - Main wire: Fast pulse (5 Hz)
  - Glow: Slower pulse (3 Hz)
- **Brighter Colors**: 
  - Active: `#22c55e` (bright green)
  - Inactive: `#64748b` (lighter gray)
- **Connection Preview**: Also enhanced with glow effect

## üéÆ Updated Controls

### Gate Movement
1. **Click once** - Select gate (yellow ring appears)
2. **Click again** - Enter drag mode (green ring appears)
3. **Move mouse** - Gate follows cursor with grid snapping
4. **Click once more** - Drop gate in new position

### Gate Resizing
- **Select gate** first (click once)
- **Hold Shift** + **Scroll Mouse Wheel**
  - Scroll up: Increase size
  - Scroll down: Decrease size
- Scale range: 0.5x to 3.0x

### Canvas Navigation
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Left Click + Drag**: Pan around workspace
- **Right Click + Drag**: Pan around workspace (alternative)
- **Middle Click + Drag**: Zoom

### Wire Creation
- **Click output pin** ‚Üí **Click input pin**
- Preview shows thick, glowing yellow line
- **ESC** to cancel
